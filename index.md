## **RESEARCH EXPERIENCE (2019 - 2021)**

- Tumor heterogeneity. Our lab developed a tool called FastClone for reconstruct tumor phylogeny and used this tool to further understand tumor heterogeneity.

- Tumor heterogeneity. We use FastClone to explore the causation of polyclonal tumor and metastatic cancer. The manuscript is being written currently. 

- Chemical properties transformation. Training an autoencoder model that can transform chemical properties by generating an analog based on the input compound.

- Drug response prediction. Finding out gene markers for Atrasentan drug response prediction and an appropriate machine learning model.

- Gene set enrichment analysis. Finding out biological pathways in mice that are associated with several drug treatments.

## **PUBLICATIONS**
- Xiao, Y. et al. FastClone is a probabilistic tool for deconvoluting tumor heterogeneity in bulk-sequencing samples. Nat. Commun. 11, 4469 (2020)

## **ACTIVITIES**
- I had a chance to be a volunteer in a high school summer campaign. I was in charge of student life and recording their activities.

- When I was in the college, I also found a club called Food Recipe Club with my friends. The club's purpose was to help members learn about other countries' food cultures and have better diets.

- I had done two more volunteer activities before, one was helping cleaners clean the ground of our community, and another one was assisting a public service organization to distribute free tea to people in summer.
