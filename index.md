## Education Experience 

- I had attended Green River College for two years. In college, I had learned the basics of botany, cell, and animal biology. I also learned organic chemistry by taking three sequential courses. For mathematics, I finished three calculus courses in this college.                       
                                                                                  (09/20015-06/2017)

- I started to attend Umich Ann Arbor in 2018 winter. The courses that I took mainly focused on the four fields: Maths, Stats, Computer Science, and Biology. I learned program language C++, R, linear algebra, probability theory, and metabolic pathway in human beings during my undergraduate program. I also took some classes about astronomy, German literature, and central European film.

- I became a Master student in 2019 Fall through the AMDP program offered by Umich. With this program, I enhanced my programming ability in the machine learning field and knowledge in computational genomics. Besides, I had taken some courses regarding computational neuroscience and NLP on health data.                                                                
                                                                                                                            (09/2019-04/2020)

## Research Experience (2019-2021)

- Tumor heterogeneity. Our lab developed a tool called FastClone for reconstruct tumor phylogeny and used this tool to further understand tumor heterogeneity.

- Tumor heterogeneity. We use FastClone to explore the causation of polyclonal tumor and metastatic cancer. The manuscript is being written currently. 

- Chemical properties transformation. Training an autoencoder model that can transform chemical properties by generating an analog based on the input compound.

- Drug response prediction. Finding out gene markers for Atrasentan drug response prediction and an appropriate machine learning model.

- Gene set enrichment analysis. Finding out biological pathways in mice that are associated with several drug treatments.

## Research publications
- Xiao, Y. et al. FastClone is a probabilistic tool for deconvoluting tumor heterogeneity in bulk-sequencing samples. Nat. Commun. 11, 4469 (2020)

## Working Experience
- I have worked in a bioinformatics lab at the University of Michigan since 2018 June. Currently, I am a research associator in this lab.
(04/2020-Present)

- I had been an English tutor in an educational institution called Kid Castle for three months.
(09/2017-12/2017)

- I had an internship in a company called Zhejiang Dongou Diagnostic Reagent Limited Company, which locates at Wenzhou. My responsibility was managing the experiment data.
(06/2017-07/2017)

- I had an internship in a health management company called Youshare. My job was teaching senior people how to use smartphones or computers to access our company's products and introducing our products to customers.

## Skills 
- Python

- R

- Adobe Illustrator

- C++

## Activities
- I had a chance to be a volunteer in a high school summer campaign. I was in charge of student life and recording their activities.

- When I was in the college, I also found a club called Food Recipe Club with my friends. The club's purpose was to help members learn about other countries' food cultures and have better diets.

- I had done two more volunteer activities before, one was helping cleaners clean the ground of our community, and another one was assisting a public service organization to distribute free tea to people in summer.
